        <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to
          spend their vacation in their native country. What haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole
          universe, with the gentle sea of the south, the thick forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the
          Putorana Plateau. And you can see all these beauties without millions in the account, a passport, or hours of
          flying. Like Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who took her three children in an armful, put them in her
          Lada and drove 20,000 kilometers across her native country. We have chosen and described some interesting
          places worthy of your vacation.</p>

            First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you'll see slopes studded with pine
            trees, mountain rivers and
            lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these
            places - the mountain air.

          <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in the Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in summer. That
            way you will see
            all the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and
            roe deer graze on the plains.

            beautiful places in Russia.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, that's all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for competitions in
            skiing. It's a sport where a skier ties himself
            to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to get as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019 at the
            festival
            "Baikal Mile" was set a world record of 197.011 km/h.</p>

            national parks have never known an axe because of impassable bogs. Some pines are more than
            half a millennium. Touch a living creature that saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it.
            In the virgin forest for a hundred kilometers you will not find a trail. And on the rare paths, the trees...
            a few meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the master here.
